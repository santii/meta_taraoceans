# BIODIVERSITY

All tables and figures of biological analysis present in the work are generated here.

1. The output files of the MEDUSA "taxonomic classification" operation are rescued.
2. This data is formatted to obtain the necessary biological information.
3. Biological diversity indices (Shannon, Shannon Normalized and Pielou) are calculated.
4. In our analysis, abundance is defined as the total number of reads assigned to a given taxon.
5. With the information about the abundance and diversity of the samples, figures were generated for analysis of some criteria.
6. FIGURES AND ANALYSIS (all figures were generated for the 7 taxonomic groups studied):
   - Dendrograms - diversity index.
   - Scatter Chart - Diversity x Abundance
   - Scatter Chart - Diversity x Station
   - Scatter Chart - Abundance x Station
   - Scatter Chart - Average of Stations x Layer
   - BoxPlot - Diversity x Layer
   - BoxPlot - Abundance x Layer
   - BoxPlot - Proportion of Domain x Layer
   - BoxPlot - Proportion of Domain x Ocean
